# Financial Market Analysis Project
This application uses Azure AutoML to forecast stock prices. 

The backend is written in Node.js, Express.js framework, and MongoDB for storing user details when registering.

Python is used for retrieving the stock data from yFinance and processing the data to a CSV which Azure AutoML will use.

A REST API layer is used to access the Azure AutoML endpoint to receive the predictions.

HTML/CSS were used with JavaScript for the web page templates. 

The application is containerized using Docker and Kubernetes for fault tolerance and scalability.
